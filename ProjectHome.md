Several ontologies are provided in OWL/RDF format, describing topic and location ontologies, but this tool and related search tools--like all Semantic Web applications--are extensible beyond these data, and the data definitions defining them.|

_1/27/08_ After a long winter's nap, I've finished the second revision of our paper detailing ConfAnnounce, ConfTrack, and the core ontologies; we're looking to have it published in the systems track of the [Journal of Web Semantics](http://www.websemanticsjournal.org/) in the upcoming year.

_11/20/07_ Currently, the only working release is the ConfAnnounce\_release.zip (Windows) download, which contains a Windows shortcut to the executable jar file, and four directories: bin, lib, ontologies, and icons. `bin` contains the executable jar and the native SWT libraries for Windows. (**Note**: for Linux users, this release **should** work perfectly, if you simply replace the SWT redistributable libraries for GTK in the 'bin' directory, and the proper swt.jar in `lib`. I haven't tried this yet though, so this isn't a guarantee). When run, `bin` will also contain `.settings` and `urls.map` file. `.settings` contains preference information (such as the set of topic ontologies loaded when the program was last closed) in binary format, and should not be edited by hand. `urls.map` contains a comma-delimited list (with \n-terminated entries) of URL-to-local file mappings that can expedite the program (downloading 3MB ontologies can each time can get tedious), and this file is intended to be edited by hand (just be sure to use an editor that inserts UNIX newlines, not Windows \r\n). A sample entry might look like:

`http://www.lehigh.edu/~mab305/swproj/conference.owl,C:\Documents and Settings\marc.bollinger\workspace\ontologies\conference.owl`

`lib` contains the necessary libraries for running ConfAnnounce, primarily the redistributable libraries from [Jena](http://jena.sourceforge.net/). The code itself contains portions of [SWT Calendar](http://swtcalendar.sourceforge.net/), which are not included in `lib`, as they were modified as necessary. `ontologies` contains a set of all ontologies necessary for minimally using ConfAnnounce, as well as some starter ontologies, one for topics (acmCCS.owl), and several for locations (Country, State, City, USState, and USCity). USCity imports all other starter ontologies, and the rest import the respectively more general ontologies as you would expect. For US conferences, this is probably a sufficient set of locations, otherwise if you do not feel like finding your own ontology and providing a mapping ontology to link it to Country/State/City, and don't care about sharing your location ontology data with others, you can create City metadata from within ConfAnnounce. This happens automatically when attempting to set a conference location to a Country (Country.owl provides an exhaustive list), and though not required, does provide some location information for the conference. Eventually, supplemental location ontologies for other countries should be available. `icons` simply contains the icons for the toolbar and executable. Don't touch those. Actually, you can. Touch those if you want.

This...doesn't work yet. The Windows and Linux executable jar files read and write data using implicit relative pathnames (e.g. "icons/ca.png" really means, "./icons/ca.png", really means, "C:\Documents and Settings\marc.bollinger\workspace\ConfAnnounce\icons\ca.png"). This would work on OS X using a similar jar and file structure, but in converting to a more appropriate .app application bundle, this is not possible, and requires some retooling, something that will take a little time.
